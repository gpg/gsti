	   GNU Secure Transport Initiative (GSTI)
           ---------------------------------------

This is a library which implements a basic part of the
protocol used by SSH to create a secure transport channel.

The drafts which describe the protocol used in the libraray can
be found in the doc/ directory:

*-architecture-*        Describes the design and the notation of SSH.
*-transport-*           How to build a secure low-level transport channel.
*-userauth-*            Protocol for the user authentication.


Please note that this library *cannot* be used to talk with SSH servers.
Even if they use the same protocol, the library is not a ssh client.

The library only includes all required algorithms to be in compliance
with the SSH drafts.

You may need the Libgcrypt 1.1.8 version from ftp.gnupg.org


Some parts of the lib design are still in flux and the code need more
tests. So please consider the library as beta version!
