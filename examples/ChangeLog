	* server.c, client.c: Fixed copyright entries from "Free Software
	Foundation, Inc" to "Werner Koch".  It was originally intended to
	assign the code to the FSF but this actually never happened and
	frankly there has been no real release as the code lived his life
	for most time merely as a test bed for libgcrypt.
