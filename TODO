GSTI's ToDo list                                       -*- outline -*-

* Find a way to handle the first packet to establish a connection.
  2002-10-01: partly done. but it's not really clean.
      
* Implement all code for sections which are marked with 'fixme' or 'todo'

* We need a way to merge BSTRING and BUFFER together. 
  They do the same things so they are redundant.

* implement the rest of the compression code in packet.c

* After the code base is somewhat stable
** Integrate SecureFTP code.
