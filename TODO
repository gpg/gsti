    * find a way to handle the first packet to establish a connection.
      2002-10-01: partly done. but it's not really clean.
      
    * add some code to set preferred algorithms (mac, cipher, compress).  

    * implement all code for sections which are marked with 'fixme' or 'todo'

    * we need a way to merge BSTRING and BUFFER together. They do the
      the same things so they are redundant.

    * implement the rest of the compression code in packet.c

After the code base is somewhat stable

    * integrate the SecureFTP code.
